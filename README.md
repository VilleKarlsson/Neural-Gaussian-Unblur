# Neural-Gaussian-Unblur
This work aims to remove gaussian blur that has been applied to a short piece of text. Generate_data.py generates and saves images of 6-letter words and their blurred versions. It also divides the data to training and test sets. After the data is created one can use the ConvNN.py to train a CNN which attempts to recreate the original image from the blurred one.
